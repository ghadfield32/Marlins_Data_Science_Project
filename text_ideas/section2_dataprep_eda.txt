| **2.1 Missing‑value audit**          | • 11/33 engineered columns have gaps (notably `exit_velo` ≈ 7.3 %) <br>• Nulls concentrated in raw Statcast measures – see *Table A1* in Appendix. | Confirms imputation strategy must treat target & predictors separately; missing EV rows cannot inform posterior ability.                   | Table A1                                                 |

| **2.3 Distribution shape**           | • Skew = −1.06 (slight left‑skew after hard‑hit peak) <br>• Kurtosis = 4.5 (>3) → leptokurtic. <br>• QQ‑plot shows heavy tails vs Normal.          | Guides choice of likelihood: skew‑normal or t‑dist better than Gaussian; improves predictive tails.                                        | **Fig 1a–c**                                             |
| **2.4 Level (quality) effect**       | One‑way ANOVA: F = 332.5, p < 10⁻¹⁴⁰ (🔹 `league_level_effect`). MLB > AAA > AA medians: 91.24 > 90.62 > 90.45 mph.                                | Necessitates fixed/partial‑pooling “level” term; model must up‑shift minor‑league EVs to MLB baseline.                                     | **Fig 2** (exit‑velo density by level – not shown above) |
| **2.5 Season/ball‑era drift**        | Mean EV dipped 0.7 mph in 2021 (“deadened” ball) then rebounded (🔹 `year_trend_ev`). Line plot 95 % CI shows trend is significant.                | Add season fixed‑effect or centre training data on 2023 ball characteristics before projecting 2024.                                       | **Fig 1d**                                               |

| **2.7 Contact‑quality covariates**   | Correlations with EV: `ev_la_sqrt` 0.63, `launch_angle` 0.14, `spray_angle` −0.01 (**Table B1** & **Fig 4**).                                      | Justifies including synthetic combo `√(EV×LA)` to soak nonlinearities; low spray correlation means we can drop it for parsimony.           | **Fig 4 (heat‑map & scatters)**                          |
| **2.8 Pitcher & sample‑size sanity** | • `pitcher_ev_mean50` correlates 0.17 → competition adjustment term. <br>• 957 batters have < 15 BIP in 2023 (see small‑sample table).             | Inform hierarchical shrinkage strength τ; small‑sample hitters borrow more league information.                                             | **Fig 5** (per‑batter EV histograms by sample size)      |
| **2.9 Autocorrelation check**        | Durbin–Watson ≈ 0 for 1 208 batters → strong positive AR(1) within player‑season.                                                                  | Optional latent AR(1) could replace independent error assumption, but deemed out‑of‑scope for first‑pass model; documented as future work. | (not included in main paper)                             |

#### Narrative summary (to drop beneath the table)

> *The exploratory phase confirms that exit velocity is mildly skewed, heavy‑tailed, level‑dependent, and exhibits measurable year‑to‑year drift driven by ball composition. We therefore specify a skew‑normal partial‑pooling model with fixed effects for competition level and season, a linear age term anchored at age 27, and a contact‑quality spline using `ev_la_sqrt`. Batters with fewer than 15 balls in play receive substantial shrinkage toward the level mean. Outlier‑down‑weighting and t‑distributed residuals protect against the 1.9 % extreme‑EV tail. A future refinement could model within‑batter AR(1) dynamics, as Durbin–Watson diagnostics indicate positive autocorrelation, but this is not critical for one‑year‑ahead projections.*

### How to slot this into the final report

1. **Section 2 header:** “Data Preparation & Exploratory Analysis”.
2. Insert the table first – reviewers instantly see each check tied to a modeling implication.
3. Follow with the narrative paragraph (≤120 words).
4. Drop selected figures under sub‑headings (“Distribution shape”, “Seasonal drift”, etc.) with tight captions: *“Fig 1a. EV histogram confirms heavy‑tail; motivates t‑likelihood.”*

That gives you a senior‑level, hypothesis‑driven EDA that is **tight, purposeful, and directly linked to subsequent modeling choices**.
